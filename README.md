# Smart_Surveillance_Rover_Project_Files
The Smart Surveillance Rover is an autonomous obstacle-avoiding robot using MSP430G2553 and Arduino UNO. MSP430 controls motors via the L298N driver and processes distance data from the HC-SR04 sensor, while Arduino handles communication and monitoring. The rover navigates intelligently, avoiding obstacles in real time.
